knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


# Basic Usage

The theme can be used by including it in the document YAML, as shown below.


```yaml
---
output: 
  mayodown::mayodocx:
    in_greeting:
        from: "Author 1 and Author 2"
        to: "Some PIs you did this report for"
        re: "An interesting title for this example"
---
```

# Sample output

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 shadow">
<iframe  class="embed-responsive-item" align = "center" width = "100%" height = "600px" allow="fullscreen" src="sample_word_output.pdf"/>
</div>

# Memo header and contact information

Headers and contact info can be removed using `header = FALSE` and `contact = FALSE`.  Default contact information will be pulled from your `.Rprofile` if it is set.

```{r eval = F}
options(mayodown.person = "First Last",
        mayodown.ext = "X-XXXX",
        mayodown.email = "Last.First@mayo.edu")
```

# Headers

The following headers are available in the default style. Headers 1-3 are left aligned and are used for headers and sub-headers.  Header 4 is centered for tables.  

<div class="shadow">
```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("word_headers.png", dpi = 600)
```
</div>

# Tables

To help generate publication-ready tables, consider using [`mRclwhip`](https://overdodactyl.github.io/mRclwhip/reference/index.html), which provides convenient wrappers around `flextable` and supports objects output from `arsenal::tableby`.


# Page breaks, multi-column layouts, landscape pages, and more

`mayodown::mayodocx` uses [`officedown`](https://github.com/davidgohel/officedown) as a base rendering engine.  This allows for the use of additional styling options like page breaks, multi-column layouts, intermixed landscape and portrait pages, styled text, and more.  


# Further Customization in Word

Some styling is still not feasible via `mayodown`.  To help format tables and images, you can consider using the following macros in word once the document is rendered. 

You will only have to add these macros to Word one time.

**About Macros**

[Create or run a macro](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-or-run-a-macro-c6b99036-905c-49a6-818a-dfb98b7c3c9c)

**Tables**

Create a macro to help standardize the look of tables outside of what can be done by `R`. 

```{sass eval = F}
Sub FormatTables()
  If ActiveDocument.Tables.Count > 0 Then
    Dim objTable As Object

    Application.Browser.Target = wdBrowseTable
    For Each objTable In ActiveDocument.Tables
      objTable.AutoFitBehavior (wdAutoFitWindow)
    Next
  End If
End Sub
```


**Put every table on it's own page**


```{sass eval = F}
Sub PagePerTable()
'
' PagePerTable Macro
'
'
 
For Each Tbl In ActiveDocument.Tables
    Set myRange = Tbl.Range
    With myRange
        .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseEnd
        .InsertBreak Type:=wdPageBreak
    End With
    Next
 
End Sub
```

**Figures**

This macro reduces the size of all figures in an active document to 45% of its original size.

```{sass eval = F}
Sub FormatFigures()

Dim shp As InlineShape

For Each shp In ActiveDocument.InlineShapes
    shp.ScaleHeight = 45
    shp.ScaleWidth = 45
Next

End Sub
```
